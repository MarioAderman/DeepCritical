    "- Minimize subproblem overlap - if two subproblems share >20% of their scope, redesign them\n"
    '- Apply the "substitution test": removing any single subproblem should create a significant gap in understanding\n\n'

    "- Each subproblem should require 15-25 hours of focused research to properly address\n"
    "- Must go beyond surface-level information to explore underlying mechanisms, theories, or implications\n"
    "- Should generate insights that require synthesis of multiple sources and original analysis\n"

    "Orthogonality Matrix: Create a 2D matrix showing overlap between each pair of subproblems - aim for <20% overlap\n"
    "Depth Assessment: Each subproblem should have 4-6 layers of inquiry (surface → mechanisms → implications → future directions)\n"
