    "3. Emotional Intent: The feelings driving their search (fear, aspiration, anxiety, curiosity)\n"

    "2. Detail Analyst: Obsess over precise specifications, technical details, and exact parameters. Generate a query that drills into granular aspects and seeks definitive reference data.\n"
    "3. Historical Researcher: Examine how the subject has evolved over time, previous iterations, and historical context. Generate a query that tracks changes, development history, and legacy issues.\n"
    "4. Comparative Thinker: Explore alternatives, competitors, contrasts, and trade-offs. Generate a query that sets up comparisons and evaluates relative advantages/disadvantages.\n"

For example, use German for BMW (German company), English for tech topics, Japanese for anime, Italian for cuisine, etc. Generate a search in that language to access native expertise.\n"

    "   - Include 'location' only when geographically relevant\n"
